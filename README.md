# OS Process Scheduling Simulator

This project implements and compares four classic CPU scheduling algorithms ‚Äî **Round Robin**, **First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)**, **Shortest Job First (SJF)**, and **Multi-Level Feedback Queue (MLFQ)** ‚Äî using UNIX signals and process control in C.  
It was developed as part of *COMPE571 ‚Äì Embedded Operating Systems (Fall 2025)*.

## üìÇ Project Overview
Each scheduler runs four child processes performing a CPU-bound workload (`myfunction()`), simulating process execution under different scheduling policies.  
The schedulers measure:
- Individual and average response times
- Context-switch overhead (for Round Robin and MLFQ)
- Statistical variation across multiple trials

The experiments follow a structured design to find the optimal quantum values for Round Robin and MLFQ and compare all algorithms using both varying and equal workloads.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Implemented Algorithms

| File | Algorithm | Description |
|------|------------|--------------|
| `RR_refined.c` | Round Robin | Time-sliced scheduling with configurable quantum (`-q <¬µs>`). Measures context-switch overhead. |
| `FCFS_refined.c` | First-Come, First-Served | Runs tasks in creation order with no preemption. Reports response times and average context-switch gap. |
| `SJF_refined.c` | Shortest Job First | Sorts processes by workload size and executes shortest jobs first. Non-preemptive. |
| `MLFQ_refined.c` | Multi-Level Feedback Queue | Two-level queue: Round Robin (top) + FCFS (bottom). Moves unfinished jobs down after their time slice. |

## üß™ Experiment Scripts

| Script | Description |
|---------|--------------|
| `run_case3a.sh` | Runs all schedulers with default workloads (Case 3a). Outputs average response times for each algorithm. |
| `run_case3b.sh` | Runs all schedulers with equal workloads (Case 3b). Calculates mean and standard deviation of response times. |
| `run_case3b_ctx.sh` | Extension of Case 3b script. Collects additional context-switch overhead data for extra-credit analysis. |
